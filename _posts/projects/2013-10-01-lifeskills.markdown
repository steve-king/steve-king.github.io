My task was to build a series of responsive, interactive "quiz" modules which share the same JS codebase, so that future modules can be more easily created. I chose to use backbone.js for this due to it's inherent flexibility. 

The modules include:

- <a href="https://www.barclayslifeskills.com/key-skills/growing-your-people-skills/rate-your-skills/" target="_blank">Rate Your Skills</a>
