Responsive, mobile first microsite to promote the launch of BMW's new fully electric car, the i3.

I was tasked with developing several of the site's content "episodes", including: 

- <a href="https://www.becomeelectric.co.uk/itest" target="_blank">Interactive questionnaire</a>
- <a href="https://www.becomeelectric.co.uk/hub/episode/7" target="_blank">Statistics infographic</a>
- <a href="https://www.becomeelectric.co.uk/hub/episode/5" target="_blank">Interactive map</a> with animated intro
- <a href="https://www.becomeelectric.co.uk/hub/episode/6" target="_blank">Speed typing game</a> incorporating HTML5 video
- <a href="https://www.becomeelectric.co.uk/hub/episode/8" target="_blank">Aggregated feed</a> of social media posts
- Many other site-wide components.

The site is built on a PHP backend using the CodeIgniter PHP framework.
