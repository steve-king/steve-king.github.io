Responsive, mobile first microsite to promote the launch of BMW's new fully electric car, the i3.

I was tasked with developing several of the site's content "episodes", including an <a href="https://www.becomeelectric.co.uk/itest" target="_blank">interactive questionnaire</a>, an <a href="https://www.becomeelectric.co.uk/hub/episode/7" target="_blank">animated statistics infographic</a>, <a href="https://www.becomeelectric.co.uk/hub/episode/5" target="_blank">interactive map showing charging locations</a>, a <a href="https://www.becomeelectric.co.uk/hub/episode/6" target="_blank">typing "game" using HTML5 video</a>, and an <a href="https://www.becomeelectric.co.uk/hub/episode/8" target="_blank">aggregated feed of social media posts</a>, as well as many other site-wide components.

The site is built on a PHP backend using the <a href="http://ellislab.com/codeigniter" target="_blank">CodeIgniter</a> framework.
