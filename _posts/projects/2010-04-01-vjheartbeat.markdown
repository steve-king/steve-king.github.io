A Flash/Actionscript 3 project I developed at Qantm College. I designed and built this site as a video portfolio for my VJ alias ‘Heartbeat’.

The site features a semi fluid, full window layout along with a preloader, custom designed video player controls, randomised home page icons, contact form, and of course, some of my videos.
