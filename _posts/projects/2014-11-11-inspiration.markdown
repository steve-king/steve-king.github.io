Site build, ongoing feature additions and maintenance of a high-traffic, fully responsive, mobile first and heavily customised Wordpress blog for Sainsbury's. Code releases were managed using advanced Git workflow and best practises, with deployments executed over Jenkins CI. Content (database and assets) syncronisation between production, staging and development environments carried out on the command line via shell scripts.

Highlights of my work on this project include: 

- The initial conception and development of the menu system for mobile devices, on which the visual design work was then retrospectively applied.
- Development of the Christmas decoration CSS theme 2 years running (2013 and 2014), to be automatically loaded onto the templates within given date ranges. Including the addition of multiple custom fields allowing fine grain control of the Christmas graphics applied to individual hero banners.
- Extensive work with Wordpress' custom post types and taxonomies on the back end to create the desired IA as requirements evolved over time.
- Added a feature for admin users to upload HTML5 video background loops to hero banners, degrading gracefully to background images.
- AJAX filtering by post type
