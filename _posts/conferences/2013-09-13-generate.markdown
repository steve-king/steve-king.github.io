title:  "Generate Conference"

I attended a great conference, "Generate", presented by net magazine. There was a broad range of topics covered across web design and development, but <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2QlYCPRpdE&list=PLb_ziuDPiUzZkc077IW3_rDcqX1OC8VbV" target="_blank">Jack Franklin's talk on "The New Era of Javascript"</a> stood out for me.
